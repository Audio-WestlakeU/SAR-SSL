# SAR-SSL
A python implementation of “**<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00476" target="_blank">Self-Supervised Learning of Spatial Acoustic Representation with Cross-Channel Signal Reconstruction and Multi-Channel Conformer</a>**”

+ **Contributions**
  - **Self-supervised learning of spatial acoustic representation (SSL-SAR):** First self-supervised learning framework for multi-channel audio signal processing
  - **Multi-channel audio Conformer (MC-Conformer):** Unified architecture for both the pretext and downstream tasks
